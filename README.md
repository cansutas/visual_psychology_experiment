# visual_psychology_experiment
Example code for a visual priming experiment I prepared for a school project. 

The instructions for the project: 
"
This experiment will make use of a number of images of living and non-living objects. A single trial consists of a prime stimulus that is presented for a very short duration (20 ms) followed immediately by a target stimulus which is presented for 150 ms. After this presentation, the user should indicate if the target stimulus is a living or non-living object. With two different types of images (living versus non-living) and two presentation types (prime versus target) we can construct four possible conditions

* Congruent living: prime = living and target = living
* Congruent non-living: prime = non-living and target = non-living
* Incongruent living: prime = non-living and target = living
* Incongruent non-living: prime = living and target = non-living
You have 20 living and 20 non-living visual stimuli which you can use. Design the experiment in such a way that each stimulus is used only once (either as a target or as a prime)
